(Mathematically I mean, please don\u0026rsquo;t try this at home). These are the two distinct types of what we call perturbations and they lead to the black hole vibrating a bit (in annoyance):\nAn animation of the quadropole vibration of a sphere. This is similar to how a perturbed black hole would vibrate.\rSo why am I interested in bugging black holes like this? It all relates to something called the Isospectrallity problem. \u0026ldquo;Iso\u0026rdquo; is a fancy way to say \u0026ldquo;equal\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;spectral\u0026rdquo; refers to the \u0026ldquo;spectrum\u0026rdquo; of the black holes vibrations. So \u0026ldquo;Isospectral\u0026rdquo; means \u0026ldquo;equal spectrum\u0026rdquo;, in this case the spectrums are the vibrations generated when we either \u0026ldquo;poke\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;spin\u0026rdquo; the black hole. Isospctrality arises from a particularly weird mathematical relationship between how a black hole reacts to being either spun or poked.\nWhile the maths of this was discovered by Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in 1983, the physical understanding of it remains a puzzling mystery.\nThe Black Hole Universe #\rTHE WHAT‚ÄΩ Okay so this idea sounds kinda nuts, our universe is inside a black hole? However, theres another way of looking at it that\u0026rsquo;s much more intuitive. In standard cosmology it\u0026rsquo;s assumed the universe is infinite: infinite mass spread over an infinite volume. Meanwhile the black hole universe instead assumes a finite universe: finite mass inside a finite volume. Outside of this finite volume, there is just empty nothingness outwards forever and ever (spooky). When we make this reasonable seeming change the universe suddenly looks like it\u0026rsquo;s inside a black hole from the outside.\nA few more consequences of this simple change include:\nDark energy. In this theory the existence of dark energy is no longer a mystery. It emerges naturally from the way the two different spacetimes (inside and outside the universe) are connected.\nCentre of the universe. Now the universe isn\u0026rsquo;t infinite it has a centre and an edge. That being said because of time-dilation you can\u0026rsquo;t ever get to the edge or see outside the universe. After all it\u0026rsquo;s in a black hole which nothing can escape from not even light.\nOrigin of the universe. We now re-interpret the origin of the universe as the formation of a black hole in that outer empty space. When a massive star collapsed under its own gravity the universe contracted, smaller and smaller, into almost a single point. It then bounced and began to expand - evolving into the universe we see today.\nCheck out this paper for all the nitty gritty physics\r","date":"5 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Sam-Franklin-Blog/research/","section":"Homepage","summary":"","title":"Research","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"3 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Sam-Franklin-Blog/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"\rContext #\r\u0026lsquo;The Pit\u0026rsquo; is a recent oneshot about classic D\u0026amp;D tropes: goblins, mimics, ancient magic and of course Pit fights. I made this to try out the \u0026lsquo;Nimble (2.0)\u0026rsquo; system with some friends. Some are experience with TTRPGs and some new to them. So this mini-dungeon should work for any group.\nAlthough we were testing Nimble I\u0026rsquo;ve written this dungeon to be system agnosic. You\u0026rsquo;ll just need to find/make a few statblocks for goblins \u0026amp; mimics in the system you\u0026rsquo;re using. I ran this at level 1 but any low level should work just change the number of enemies in your combats.\nThe Premise #\rThe heroes are an established adventuring party who travelled into the forest to slay the Goblin King \u0026lsquo;Glarbo\u0026rsquo;. Unfortunately for our heroes they were ambushed and captured by Glarbos minons. The adventure now begins with the players waking up together within \u0026ldquo;The Pit\u0026rdquo;.\nThe Pit #\rThe fighting pit #\rThe party awakenes to the goblin king laughing maniechally at them from above. A crowd of goblins cheer him on.\nCombat: The gates to the pit open letting in the parties first combatants. whatever these are is up to you as a DM. It could be a group of poor creatures the goblins also captured or a group of misbehaving goblins. I decided my group would fight some goblin ratriders, bounding around on the back of their giant rats.\nObjects/areas:\nA rusty magic sword buried under the rubble missing a gem needed to activate it A number of hung lanterns around the edges (only 2 still work) Pit prisons #\rAfter the fight is done the players are thrown in this circular room to catch their breath and get ready for their next fight. People:\nA well toned human fighter (Stephen Bur) known by the goblins as the champions. He‚Äôs covered in blood and heavily traumatised from the bad conditions. Creatures:\nA chained up giant Komodo dragon/ salamander with a fire breath attack Several chained up giant rats covered in flees, dirt and disease Objects/ areas:\nSecret hatch from ancient times in a statue. To trigger a weapon/ pickaxe must be placed in the statues hand (which is currently empty). Leads to secret room Prisoner barracks with poorly built weapons (they break on a missed attack) 2 Gated stairwells guarded by 4 goblins each. Happy to spit insults and throw shit at the PCs. Leads to pit seating Secret Hatch Room #\rA small circular room only found through the hidden hatch on the statue in the Pit Prisons\nObjects/ areas:\nA stone ladder built into the wall. At the top is a hatch hidden to blend in the with stone floor slates in the seating area. Leads to pit seating A red gemstone (matched with the one for the magic sword) embedded in a ‚Äòchest‚Äô (mimic) Strange runes mark the walls spiralling upwards. In 4 sections: for wind, fire, ice and lightning. When a spell of appropriate type is cast on each a secret hatch containing a magic wand will open. Pit seating #\rSeveral goblins watch as a new fight begins in the pit. If not recruited by the party Stephen Bur is put up against an owl bear (and is swiftly torn to shreds).\nObjects/ areas:\nTicket booth entrance/ exit. Two goblins struggle to keep up with the long queue of those coming to see the shows. Leads to goblin barracks. Goblin Barracks #\rThe shoddily crafted shack built around the pit. Here the group must fight the goblin king, using his traps, tricks and goblin loyalists.\nFinal comments #\rYou\u0026rsquo;ll notice lots of what I\u0026rsquo;ve written here for combat is light on details. That is intentional! I\u0026rsquo;m quite an experienced DM at this point so for this oneshot I was balancing on the fly. In my campaign I always prep combat in more detail but Nimble 2 allowed me to improvise on the fly and I decided to make full use of that this time.\nHappy gaming üêâ!\n","date":"3 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Sam-Franklin-Blog/posts/cryptic-secrets---the-pit/","section":"Posts","summary":"A recent oneshot dungeon I made with goblins, mimics and pit fights","title":"Cryptic Secrets: The Pit","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"3 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Sam-Franklin-Blog/tags/dd/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"D\u0026D","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"3 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Sam-Franklin-Blog/categories/life-blog/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Life-Blog","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"3 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Sam-Franklin-Blog/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"3 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Sam-Franklin-Blog/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"3 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Sam-Franklin-Blog/tags/ttrpgs/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"TTRPGs","type":"tags"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m Sam, a PhD candidate studying theoretical black hole physics.
