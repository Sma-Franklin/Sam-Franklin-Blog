This produces a characteristic signal with three distinct regions: the inspiral, the merger and the ringdown. The inspiral phase is generated while the two black holes orbit one another although its only detectable for a few seconds when they\u0026rsquo;re close enough. The merger is the peak of the signal from when the black holes actually coalesce. Finally the ringdown happens after the peak of the merger as the spacetime around the remnant black hole settles down.\nAn example of a typical gravitational wave signal from a black hole merger\rDirect Waves #\rIn the last few months the line between the Merger and Ringdown has been blurred. New Theoretical research and observational signals suggest the existence of a new type of gravitational wave called a \u0026ldquo;direct wave\u0026rdquo;. These direct waves are emitted right at the end of the merger as the black holes plunge towards one another. They are generated directly by orbital motion, but the signal is strongly altered by the spin and gravity of the remnant black hole meaning we can predict it theoretically. These differ from the well understood quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of the ringdown signal, which are generated after merging without orbital motion.\nA schematic diagram of direct wave emission for an extreme mass ratio inspiral.\rWithin the last 2 months several important tests of direct wave have made. Firstly their existence was verified by some clever analysis on numerical relativity simulations. Secondly a direct wave was discovered in the signal of an actual gravitational wave (GW250114).\nThe signal for GW250114, before removing the QNMs (top), after removing the QNM (middle), and after removing the direct wave (bottom).\rWhy do we care? #\rFinding these direct waves and being able to detect them is a pretty huge deal in the long run. Since their signal is dominated by the physics of the remnant black hole we can understand them analytically. With this analytical understanding they provide an independent technique to measure the merged black holes mass and spin. This can be combined with results found from analysing the inspiral and QNMs to produce a very precise result.\nReferences #\rSome of the images in this post were taken from the following papers.\nCheck out this paper for the observation of Direct Waves\rCheck out this paper for the theory behind Direct Waves\r","date":"1 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Sam-Franklin-Blog/posts/gravitational-waves---direct-waves/","section":"Posts","summary":"In a recent black hole merger events a new type of gravitational wave might have been detected.

There are the two distinct types of what we call perturbations and they lead to the black hole spacetime vibrating (in annoyance):\nAn animation of the quadropole vibration of a sphere. This is similar to how a perturbed black hole spacetime would vibrate.\rSo why am I interested in bugging black holes like this? Im interested in something called the Isospectrallity problem. \u0026ldquo;Iso\u0026rdquo; is a fancy way to say \u0026ldquo;equal\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;spectral\u0026rdquo; refers to the \u0026ldquo;spectrum\u0026rdquo; of the black holes vibrations. So \u0026ldquo;Isospectral\u0026rdquo; means \u0026ldquo;equal spectrum\u0026rdquo;, in this case the spectrums are the vibrations generated when we either \u0026ldquo;poke\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;spin\u0026rdquo; the black hole. Isospctrality arises from a particularly weird mathematical relationship between how a black hole reacts to being either spun or poked.\nWhile the maths of this was discovered by Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in 1983, the physical understanding of it remains a puzzling mystery. Im particularly interested in investigating if black isospectrality remains when we account for quantum effects like Hawkin radiation at the black hole horizon.\nBlack Hole Cosmologies #\rIn standard cosmology it\u0026rsquo;s assumed the universe is infinite: infinite mass spread over an infinite volume. Black hole cosmologies instead assumes a finite universe: finite mass inside a finite volume. Outside of this finite volume, there is just empty nothingness outwards forever and ever (spooky). When we make this reasonable seeming change the universe suddenly looks like it\u0026rsquo;s inside a black hole from the outside.\nA few more consequences of this simple change include:\nDark energy. In this model the existence of dark energy is no longer a mystery. It emerges naturally from the way the two different spacetimes (inside and outside the universe) are connected.\nCentre of the universe. Now the universe isn\u0026rsquo;t infinite it has a centre and an edge. That being said because of time-dilation you can\u0026rsquo;t ever get to the edge or see outside the universe. After all it\u0026rsquo;s in a black hole which nothing can escape from not even light.\nOrigin of the universe. We now re-interpret the origin of the universe as the formation of a black hole in that outer empty space. When a massive star collapsed under its own gravity the universe contracted, smaller and smaller, into almost a single point. It then bounced and began to expand - evolving into the universe we see today.\nCheck out this paper for the theory\r","date":"5 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Sam-Franklin-Blog/research/","section":"Homepage","summary":"","title":"Research","type":"page"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m Sam, a PhD candidate studying theoretical black hole physics at the institute of cosmology and gravitation in Portsmouth.\nAside from physics I have a wide variety of hobbies including: reading, board games, weight lifting, guitar, and mini-painting.
