Here I\u0026rsquo;ll give a quick overview of what this new signature is, how it was found and how it could be useful.\nBackground #\rTo give you some context, the gravitational waves we detect at the moment are most often from the merging of two black holes. This produces a characteristic signal with three distinct regions: the inspiral, the merger and the ringdown. The inspiral phase is generated while the two black holes orbit one another although it\u0026rsquo;s only detectable for a few seconds when they\u0026rsquo;re close enough. The merger is the peak of the signal from when the black holes actually coalesce. Finally the ringdown happens after the peak of the merger as the spacetime around the remnant black hole settles down.\nAn example of a typical gravitational wave signal from a black hole merger\rDirect Waves #\rIn the last few months the line between the Merger and Ringdown has been blurred. New Theoretical research and observational signals suggest the existence of a new type of gravitational wave called a \u0026ldquo;direct wave\u0026rdquo;. These direct waves are emitted right at the end of the merger as the black holes plunge towards one another. They are generated directly by orbital motion, but the signal is strongly altered by the spin and gravity of the remnant black hole meaning we can predict it theoretically. These differ from the well understood quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of the ringdown signal, which are generated after merging without orbital motion.\nA schematic diagram of direct wave emission for an extreme mass ratio inspiral.\rWithin the last 2 months several important tests of direct wave have been made. Firstly their existence was verified by some clever analysis on numerical relativity simulations. Secondly a direct wave was discovered in the signal of an actual gravitational wave (GW250114).\nThe signal for GW250114, before removing the QNMs (top), after removing the QNMs (middle), and after removing the direct wave (bottom).\rWhy do we care? #\rFinding these direct waves and being able to detect them is a pretty huge deal in the long run. Since their signal is dominated by the physics of the remnant black hole we can understand them analytically. With this analytical understanding they provide an independent technique to measure the merged black holes mass and spin. This can be combined with results found from analysing the inspiral and QNMs to produce a very precise result.\nReferences #\rSome of the images in this post were taken from the following papers.\nCheck out this paper for the observation of Direct Waves\rCheck out this paper for the theory behind Direct Waves\r","date":"1 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Sam-Franklin-Blog/posts/gravitational-waves---direct-waves/","section":"Posts","summary":"Have we missed a hidden signal in black hole mergers?

There are the two distinct types of what we call perturbations and they lead to the black hole spacetime vibrating (in annoyance):\nAn animation of the quadropole vibration of a sphere. This is similar to how a perturbed black hole spacetime would vibrate.\rSo why am I interested in bugging black holes like this? I\u0026rsquo;m interested in something called the Isospectrality problem. \u0026ldquo;Iso\u0026rdquo; is a fancy way to say \u0026ldquo;equal\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;spectral\u0026rdquo; refers to the \u0026ldquo;spectrum\u0026rdquo; of the black holes vibrations. So \u0026ldquo;Isospectral\u0026rdquo; means \u0026ldquo;equal spectrum\u0026rdquo;, in this case the spectrums are the vibrations generated when we either \u0026ldquo;poke\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;spin\u0026rdquo; the black hole. Isospectrality arises from a particularly weird mathematical relationship between how a black hole reacts to being either spun or poked.\nWhile the maths of this was discovered by Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in 1983, the physical understanding of it remains a puzzling mystery. I\u0026rsquo;m particularly interested in investigating if black hole isospectrality remains when we account for quantum effects like Hawking radiation at the black hole horizon.\nBlack Hole Cosmologies #\rIn standard cosmology it\u0026rsquo;s assumed the universe is infinite: infinite mass spread over an infinite volume. Black hole cosmologies instead assumes a finite universe: finite mass inside a finite volume. Outside of this finite volume, there is just empty nothingness outwards forever and ever (spooky). When we make this reasonable seeming change the universe suddenly looks like it\u0026rsquo;s inside a black hole from the outside.\nA few more consequences of this simple change include:\nDark energy. In this model the existence of dark energy is no longer a mystery. It emerges naturally from the way the two different spacetimes (inside and outside the universe) are connected.\nCentre of the universe. Now the universe isn\u0026rsquo;t infinite it has a centre and an edge. That being said because of time-dilation you can\u0026rsquo;t ever get to the edge or see outside the universe. After all it\u0026rsquo;s in a black hole which nothing can escape from not even light.\nOrigin of the universe. We now re-interpret the origin of the universe as the formation of a black hole in that outer empty space. When a massive star collapsed under its own gravity the universe contracted, smaller and smaller, into almost a single point. It then bounced and began to expand - evolving into the universe we see today.\nCheck out this paper for the theory\r","date":"5 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Sam-Franklin-Blog/research/","section":"Homepage","summary":"","title":"Research","type":"page"},{"content":"\rContext #\r\u0026lsquo;The Pit\u0026rsquo; is a recent oneshot about classic D\u0026amp;D tropes: goblins, mimics, ancient magic and of course Pit fights. I made this to try out the \u0026lsquo;Nimble (2.0)\u0026rsquo; system with some friends. Some are experience with TTRPGs and some new to them. So this mini-dungeon should work for any group.\nAlthough we were testing Nimble I\u0026rsquo;ve written this dungeon to be system agnostic. You\u0026rsquo;ll just need to find/make a few statblocks for goblins \u0026amp; mimics in the system you\u0026rsquo;re using. I ran this at level 1 but any low level should work just change the number of enemies in your combats.\nThe Premise #\rThe heroes are an established adventuring party who travelled into the forest to slay the Goblin King \u0026lsquo;Glarbo\u0026rsquo;. Unfortunately for our heroes they were ambushed and captured by Glarbo\u0026rsquo;s minions. The adventure now begins with the players waking up together within \u0026ldquo;The Pit\u0026rdquo;.\nThe Pit #\rThe fighting pit #\rThe party awakens to the goblin king laughing maniacally at them from above. A crowd of goblins cheer him on.\nCombat: The gates to the pit open letting in the parties first combatants. whatever these are is up to you as a DM. It could be a group of poor creatures the goblins also captured or a group of misbehaving goblins. I decided my group would fight some goblin ratriders, bounding around on the back of their giant rats.\nObjects/areas:\nA rusty magic sword buried under the rubble missing a gem needed to activate it A number of hanging lanterns around the edges (only 2 still work) Pit prisons #\rAfter the fight is done the players are thrown in this circular room to catch their breath and get ready for their next fight. People:\nA well toned human fighter (Stephen Bur) known by the goblins as the champions. He’s covered in blood and heavily traumatised from the bad conditions. Creatures:\nA chained up giant Komodo dragon/ salamander with a fire breath attack Several chained up giant rats covered in fleas, dirt and disease Objects/ areas:\nSecret hatch from ancient times in a statue. To trigger a weapon/ pickaxe must be placed in the statues hand (which is currently empty). Leads to secret room Prisoner barracks with poorly built weapons (they break on a missed attack) 2 Gated stairwells guarded by 4 goblins each. Happy to spit insults and throw shit at the PCs. Leads to pit seating Secret Hatch Room #\rA small circular room only found through the hidden hatch on the statue in the Pit Prisons\nObjects/ areas:\nA stone ladder built into the wall. At the top is a hatch hidden to blend in the with stone floor slates in the seating area. Leads to pit seating A red gemstone (matched with the one for the magic sword) embedded in a ‘chest’ (mimic). When placed into the sword it becomes a flame tongue. Strange runes mark the walls spiralling upwards. In 4 sections: for wind, fire, ice and lightning. When a spell of appropriate type is cast on each a secret hatch containing a magic wand will open. Pit seating #\rSeveral goblins watch as a new fight begins in the pit. If not recruited by the party Stephen Bur is put up against an owl bear (and is swiftly torn to shreds).\nObjects/ areas:\nTicket booth entrance/ exit. Two goblins struggle to keep up with the long queue of those coming to see the shows. Leads to goblin barracks. Goblin Barracks #\rThe shoddily crafted shack built around the pit. Here the group must fight the goblin king, using his traps, tricks and goblin loyalists.\nFinal comments #\rYou\u0026rsquo;ll notice lots of what I\u0026rsquo;ve written here for combat is light on details. That is intentional! I\u0026rsquo;m quite an experienced DM at this point so for this oneshot I was balancing on the fly. In my campaign I always prep combat in more detail but Nimble 2 allowed me to improvise on the fly and I decided to make full use of that this time.\nHappy gaming 🐉!\n","date":"3 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/Sam-Franklin-Blog/posts/cryptic-secrets---the-pit/","section":"Posts","summary":"Escape the Goblin King in \u0026lsquo;The Pit,\u0026rsquo; a system-agnostic TTRPG oneshot.
