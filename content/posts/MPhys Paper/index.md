A copy of my MPhys Thesis paper on simulating the hydrodynamics of stellar explosions followed by a pulsar wind on a moving-mesh. 

In this paper I use a relativistic hydrodynamics solver "GAMMA" written in C++ to simulate the fluid dynamics of a gamma ray burst (GRB). I edited the code so that the initial GRB explosion is followed by an injection of a high energy pulsar wind.
I use the results of such a simulation to demonstrate how such a situation produces plateaus in the GRB afterglow, a feature seen regularly in observed data.
