## Context
'The Pit' is a recent oneshot about classic D&D tropes: goblins, mimics,  ancient magic and of course Pit fights.
I made this to try out the 'Nimble (2.0)' system with some friends. Some are experience with TTRPGs and some new to them. So this mini-dungeon should work for any group.

Although we were testing Nimble I've written this dungeon to be system agnostic. You'll just need to find/make a few statblocks for goblins & mimics in the system you're using. I ran this at level 1 but any low level should work just change the number of enemies in your combats.

## The Premise
The heroes are an established adventuring party who travelled into the forest to slay the Goblin King 'Glarbo'.
Unfortunately for our heroes they were ambushed and captured by Glarbo's minions. The adventure now begins with the players waking up together within "The Pit".

## The Pit
### The fighting pit
The party awakens to the goblin king laughing maniacally at them from above. A crowd of goblins cheer him on.

**Combat:** The gates to the pit open letting in the parties first combatants. whatever these are is up to you as a DM. It could be a group of poor creatures the goblins also captured or a group of misbehaving goblins. I decided my group would fight some goblin ratriders, bounding around on the back of their giant rats.

**Objects/areas:** 
- A rusty magic sword buried under the rubble missing a gem needed to activate it
- A number of hanging lanterns around the edges (only 2 still work)


### Pit prisons 
After the fight is done the players are thrown in this circular room to catch their breath and get ready for their next fight.
**People:**
- A well toned human fighter (Stephen Bur) known by the goblins as the champions. He’s covered in blood and heavily traumatised from the bad conditions.

**Creatures:** 
- A chained up giant Komodo dragon/ salamander with a fire breath attack
- Several chained up giant rats covered in fleas, dirt and disease

**Objects/ areas:**
- Secret hatch from ancient times in a statue. To trigger a weapon/ pickaxe must be placed in the statues hand (which is currently empty). _**Leads to secret room**_
- Prisoner barracks with poorly built weapons (they break on a missed attack)
- 2 Gated stairwells guarded by 4 goblins each. Happy to spit insults and throw shit at the PCs. _**Leads to pit seating**_

### Secret Hatch Room
A small circular room only found through the hidden hatch on the statue in the _**Pit Prisons**_

**Objects/ areas:**
- A stone ladder built into the wall. At the top is a hatch hidden to blend in the with stone floor slates in the seating area.  _**Leads to pit seating**_
- A red gemstone (matched with the one for the magic sword) embedded in a ‘chest’ (mimic). When placed into the sword it becomes a flame tongue.
- Strange runes mark the walls spiralling upwards. In 4 sections: for wind, fire, ice and lightning. When a spell of appropriate type is cast on each a secret hatch containing a magic wand will open.

### Pit seating
Several goblins watch as a new fight begins in the pit. If not recruited by the party Stephen Bur is put up against an owl bear (and is swiftly torn to shreds).

**Objects/ areas:**
- Ticket booth entrance/ exit. Two goblins struggle to keep up with the long queue of those coming to see the shows. _**Leads to goblin barracks.**_

### Goblin Barracks
The shoddily crafted shack built around the pit. Here the group must fight the goblin king, using his traps, tricks and goblin loyalists.

## Final comments
You'll notice lots of what I've written here for combat is light on details. That is intentional! I'm quite an experienced DM at this point so for this oneshot I was balancing on the fly. In my campaign I always prep combat in more detail but Nimble 2 allowed me to improvise on the fly and I decided to make full use of that this time.

Happy gaming 🐉!
