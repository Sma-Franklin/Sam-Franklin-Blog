## Background
To give you some context, the gravitational waves we detect at the moment are most often from the merging of two black holes. This produces a characteristic signal with three distinct regions: the inspiral, the merger and the ringdown. The inspiral phase is generated while the two black holes orbit one another although its only detectable for a few seconds when they're close enough. The merger is the peak of the signal from when the black holes actually coalesce. Finally the ringdown happens after the peak of the merger as the spacetime around the remnant black hole settles down.

## Direct Waves
In the last few months the line between the Merger and Ringdown has been blurred. New Theoretical research and observational signals suggest the existence of a new type of gravitational wave called a "direct wave". 
These direct waves are emitted right at the end of the merger as the black holes plunge towards one another. 
They are generated directly by orbital motion, but the signal is strongly altered by the spin and gravity of the remnant black hole meaning we can predict it theoretically.
These differ from the well understood quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of the ringdown signal, which are generated after merging without orbital motion.

Within the last 2 months several important tests of direct wave have made.
Firstly their existence was verified by some clever analysis on numerical relativity simulations. 
Secondly a direct wave was discovered in the signal of an actual gravitational wave (GW250114).

## Why do we care?
Finding these direct waves and being able to detect them is a pretty huge deal in the long run. 
Since their signal is dominated by the physics of the remnant black hole we can understand them analytically. 
With this analytical understanding they provide an independent technique to measure the merged black holes mass and spin.
This can be combined with results found from analysing the inspiral and QNMs to produce a very precise result.
