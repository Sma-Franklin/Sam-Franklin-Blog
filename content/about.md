I'm Sam, a PhD candidate studying theoretical black hole physics at the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation in Portsmouth.

Aside from physics I have a wide variety of hobbies including: reading, board games, weight lifting, guitar, and mini-painting.
I'll be posting about some of these interests here alongside my science posts.
