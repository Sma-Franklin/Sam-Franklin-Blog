I'm Sam, a PhD candidate studying theoretical black hole physics. I study at the institute of cosmology and gravitation in Portsmouth.

Aside from physics I have a wide variety of hobbies including: D&D, weight lifting, reading, guitar and mini-painting.
I'll be posting about some of these interests here alongside my science posts.
