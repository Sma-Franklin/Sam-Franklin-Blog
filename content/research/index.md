# The Black Hole Isospectrallity Problem
My main research interest at the moment is investigating what happens to black holes when we spin or poke them a little bit? (Mathematically I mean, please don't try this at home). These are the two distinct types of what we call perturbations and they lead to the black hole vibrating a bit (in annoyance):

![An animation of the quadropole vibration of a sphere. This is similar to how a perturbed black hole would vibrate](/images/quadrupole_vibration.gif "An animation of the quadropole vibration of a sphere. This is similar to how a perturbed black hole would vibrate.")

So why am I interested in bugging black holes like this? 
It all relates to something called the Isospectrallity problem. 
"Iso" is a fancy way to say "equal" and "spectral" refers to the "spectrum" of the black holes vibrations. 
So "Isospectral" means "equal spectrum", in this case the spectrums are the vibrations generated when we either "poke" or "spin" the black hole.
Isospctrality arises from a particularly weird mathematical relationship between how a black hole reacts to being either spun or poked.

While the maths of this was discovered by Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in 1983, the physical understanding of it remains a puzzling mystery. 

# The Black Hole Universe
THE WHATâ€½ Okay so this idea sounds kinda nuts, our universe is inside a black hole? 
However, theres another way of looking at it that's much more intuitive. 
In standard cosmology it's assumed the universe is infinite: infinite mass spread over an infinite volume. Meanwhile the black hole universe instead assumes a finite universe: finite mass inside a finite volume. Outside of this finite volume, there is just empty nothingness outwards forever and ever (spooky).
When we make this reasonable seeming change the universe suddenly looks like it's inside a black hole from the outside. 

A few more consequences of this simple change include:

**Dark energy.** In this theory the existence of dark energy is no longer a mystery. It emerges naturally from the way the two different spacetimes (inside and outside the universe) are connected.

**Centre of the universe.** Now the universe isn't infinite it has a centre and an edge. That being said because of time-dilation you can't ever get to the edge or see outside the universe. After all it's in a black hole which nothing can escape from not even light. 

**Origin of the universe.** We now re-interpret the origin of the universe as the formation of a black hole in that outer empty space. When a massive star collapsed under its own gravity the universe contracted, smaller and smaller, into almost a single point. It then bounced and began to expand - evolving into the universe we see today.
