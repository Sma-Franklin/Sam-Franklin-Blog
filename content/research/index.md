# Bugging Black Holes
What happens to a black hole when we spin it or poke it a little bit? (Mathematically I mean, please don't try this in real life). This is what we call a black hole perturbation and it leads to the black hole wobbling (in annoyance).

So why am I interested in bugging black holes like this?
