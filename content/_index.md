I'm Sam, a graduate researcher at the [Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation](https://www.port.ac.uk/research/institute-of-cosmology-and-gravitation) in Portsmouth. 
My primary research interest is **black hole perturbation theory** and the quasinormal ringdown of gravitational waves. 
I am currently studying how applying quantum boundary conditions at the horizon changes quasinormal mode spectra and the isospectrality between axial and polar perturbations. 

I am supervised by [Professor Enrique Gaztanaga](https://darkcosmos.com/), [Professor Kazuya Koyama](https://www.port.ac.uk/about-us/structure-and-governance/our-people/our-staff/kazuya-koyama), and [Dr Sravan Kumar Korumilli](https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/en/persons/sravan-kumar-korumilli/).

Aside from physics I have a wide variety of hobbies including: reading, board games, weight lifting, guitar, and mini-painting.
I'll be posting about some of these interests here alongside my science posts.
