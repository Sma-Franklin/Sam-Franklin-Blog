# Welcome!
Here you can find out all about my research into black holes and read my posts about whatever else I'm interested in.
Expect general relativity, cosmology, QFT on curved spacetime, machine learning and more. 

You might also be interested in checking out my posts about some of my hobbies like book reviews, board games and travel.

If you're interested in my credentials here is my CV!
